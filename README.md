## Voice Training Tips

### For Beginners
- Start with the "Quick Practice Sentences"
- Use a lower target note (A3, B3, C4) initially
- Practice with the drone at 50-75% volume
- Focus on matching pitch rather than perfect articulation

### Advanced Practice
- Try the specialized monologue exercises
- Experiment with different timbres to challenge pitch recognition
- Practice without the drone, then check with the pitch monitor
- Work on maintaining pitch while emphasizing different syllables

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues
- **No drone sound**: Check browser volume and audio permissions
- **Pitch detection not working**: Verify microphone access and speak louder
- **Distorted audio**: Try enabling "Soften Highs" or reducing volume

### Performance Issues
- **Laggy interface**: Close other browser tabs, try Chrome
- **Battery drain on mobile**: Disable phone boost when on battery power
- **Poor pitch accuracy**: Reduce background noise, speak closer to microphone

### Browser Issues
- **HTTPS required**: Use `https://` or `localhost` for microphone access
- **No microphone permission**: Check browser settings and grant access
- **Audio context issues**: Click a button to initialize audio on mobile Safari
